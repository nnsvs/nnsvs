# Clip input context features to the range in the training data.
# NOTE: While this would prevent unstable behaviors for test data,
# it will also cause the model not to generalize well.
# For example, it will be difficult to generate correct notes that are
# not included in the training data.
# It is recommended to set to false, especially when you have enough data
# and expect your model to generalize well.
