# Vibrato mode (https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02776)
# 1) none -> no vibrato modeling
#   The output features will include 4 streams: [mgc, lf0, vuv, bap]
# 2) sine -> sine vibrato modeling.
#   Three-dim features composed of two streams (vib params and vibrato flag) are added.
#   The output features will include 6 streams: [mgc, lf0, vuv, bap, vib, vib_flags]
# 3) diff -> diff-based vibrato modeling.
#   One-dim differential F0 is added.
#   The output features will include 5 streams: [mgc, lf0, vuv, bap, vib]
# NOTE: you must be careful about the dimension of the acoustic features.
# For example, if you use sine-based vibrato modeling (w/ dynamic features),
# you'd need to increase 2*num_windows + 1 for the `out_dim` of the acoustic model.
